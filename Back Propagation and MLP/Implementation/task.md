# Task Description

Now we want to implement automatic backpropagation.

You can see that **backward** function is already implemented. 
So, your task is to implement all the functions of basic arithmetic operations.

Look at addition operations for example and implement a similar function for other arithmetic operations.

Use the knowledge gained in tasks 1 and 2 to successfully cope with this task!
