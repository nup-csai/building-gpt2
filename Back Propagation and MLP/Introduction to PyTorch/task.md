In the previous task you could observe the work of the PyTorch library.
It is a very powerful tool for working with machine learning in Python.

In this lesson you are invited to run different code fragments in **Jupiter notebook** to master the basic capabilities of this library.

**Tensors**

Tensors are a specialized data structure that are very similar to arrays and matrices.
In PyTorch, we use tensors to encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the modelâ€™s parameters.

Tensors can be *initialized* in various ways. Take a look at the following examples(1-3):

Tensor *attributes* describe their shape, datatype, and the device on which they are stored(4).

Tensors contain over 100 *operations*, including arithmetic, linear algebra, matrix manipulation.
You can see some basic operations in examples (5-8)

Tensors on the CPU and *NumPy arrays* can share their underlying memory locations, and changing one will change the other(9-11).
